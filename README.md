## 💡 Why I Built This

> "I'm a solo developer. I move fast, I 'vibecode,' and I trust AI to write my logic. But I also know that one simple mistake — an unescaped `eval` or a leaked API key — can ruin everything."

Standard security tools are built for 500-person enterprise companies. They are slow, full of false positives, and frankly, boring to use. I wanted something that felt like **Claude Code**: fast, smart, and designed for the creative developer who just wants to "Get Shit Done" without getting hacked.

So I built this. A system that doesn't just look for generic patterns, but actually *understands* the context of your code using agentic reasoning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
This tool is built on **Claude Code**. You must have it installed:
- **Windows**: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
- **MacOS/Linux**: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`

### 2. Installation
Run this one command to install and start the dashboard:
```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakky8/claude-code-security-review-v2/main/install.ps1)
```

**Verify with:**
Open your browser to [http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:8089)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Initialize**: Select your provider (Claude, OpenAI, or DeepSeek) and enter your API key.
2.  **Multi-Source Feed**: Paste a snippet, upload a whole folder, or drop a GitHub link. The system consumes them all simultaneously.
3.  **Hybrid Scan**: The engine runs two layers of defense:
    *   **Tier 1: Static Layer**: Instant regex-based detection of dangerous hooks (RCE, Injection).
    *   **Tier 2: AI Layer**: Deep semantic reasoning to find logical flaws and architectural risks using **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**.
4.  **Results & Remediation**: Get a prioritized list of findings with severity ratings and specific recommendations on how to fix them.
