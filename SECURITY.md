## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Claude Code Security Reviewer, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1.  **Private GitHub Advisory**: If you have permissions, open a draft security advisory in this repository.
2.  **Email**: Contact the maintainer directly (if applicable) or file a non-public issue requesting a secure communication channel.

You should expect to receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up by email to ensure we received your original message.
